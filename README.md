## FAQ

#### What is the stack?

P.E.R.N. (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js)

#### What type of technologies were used?

Due to the nature of this project being required to reach MVP within 25 days, from server to client side, a host of packages were implemented to quicken progress on the client side. 

- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 3.0
- Material UI
- React-Router-Dom V6
- React-Player
- React Legacy (Class Components)

#### Who designed the logo? 

Well, I did! I have over half a decade of experience in Illustrator and spent around 30 minutes on producing it.

#### What was your inspiration?

I am a die-hard NBA fan. In the midst of working a full-time job as well as averaging 5 hours a night coding for my part-time bootcamp with Eleven Fifty Academy, I was unable to watch any games or keep up. I started to rely on Twitter or Reddit.com/r/NBA for highlights yet both were cumbersome to do so. I wanted a one-stop shop where I could find the highlights I wanted to see --- so I decided to make it myself.

#### Do you plan on doing upkeep with this project and continuining its development?

Yes! Soon enough I will provide an experience beyond the scope of my intensive class. I may make it open-source in the future as well as I'd love to work with the community to build the best experience for all.

#### Are you looking for a job?

Indeed I am. Feel free to reach out to me via my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexleemyers/) if you have positions available for front-end, back-end, and/or full-stack.
